Spatch, Michael Paquier
=======================

Spatch is an environment manager for Home. It can manipulate dynamically
configuration files and environments available with simple commands.

Please refer to the help for more information about functionalities.

The configuration sets files that spatch can manipulate are located in folders
of the type:
$HOME/.spatch.d/$CONFIG_NAME
where $CONFIG_NAME is the name of the folder containing all the configuration
files to be copied to your home repository.

You can refer to the example set in $HOME/.spatch.d/example giving a model of
how to set a configuration set. The set "default" can also be used as a base.
Except "default" and "example", all the other configuration sets of are ignored
by Home.

Spatch has been created to be implemented in Home and respects the same
license, so feel free to use it and contribute to it.
