Spatch, Michael Paquier
=======================

Spatch is an environment manager for Home. It can manipulate dinamically
configuration files and environments available with simple commands.

Please refer to the help for more information on functionalities.

Regarding the sets of configuration files that spatch can manipulate.
They are located in folders of the type:
$HOME/.spatch.d/$CONFIG_NAME
where $CONFIG_NAME is the name of the folder containing all the configuration
files to be copied to your home repository.

You can refer to the example set in $HOME/.spatch.d/example giving a model of
how to set a configuration set. The set "default" can also be used as a base.
Except "default" and "example", all the other sets of configuration are ignored
by Home.

Spatch has been created to be implemented in Home and respects the same license,
so feel free to use and contribute to it.
