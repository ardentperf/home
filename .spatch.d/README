Spatch, Michael Paquier
=======================

Spatch is a switcher for configuration files in Linux environments. The purpose
of spatch is to give the user the possibility to change a set of configuration
files with a single command.

The sets of configuration files are located in folders of the type:
$HOME/.spatch.d/$CONFIG_NAME
where $CONFIG_NAME is the name of the folder containing all the configuration
files to be copied to your home repository.

You can refer to the example set in $HOME/.spatch.d/example giving a model of
how to set a configuration set. The set "default" can also be used as a base.
Except "default" and "example", all the other sets of configuration are ignored
by Home.

Spatch has been created to be implemented in Home and respects the same license,
so feel free to use and contribute to it.

For the time being spatch has only basic functionalities.
- Switch a set of files:
spatch switch $CONFIG_NAME
- Show the description of a set of files:
spatch desc $CONFIG_NAME
- List the configuration files of a set:
spatch list $CONFIG_NAME
- Show current configuration
spatch show

When no configuration name is specified, the current configuration is used.
