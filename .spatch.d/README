Spatch, Michael Paquier
=======================

Spatch is an environment manager for Home. It can manipulate dynamically
configuration files and environments available with simple commands.

Please refer to the help for more information about available features.

The configuration sets files that spatch can manipulate are located in folders
of the type:

    $HOME/.spatch.d/$CONFIG_NAME

where $CONFIG_NAME is the name of the folder containing all the configuration
files to be copied to your home repository.

You can refer to the example set in $HOME/.spatch.d/example giving a model of
how to set a configuration set. The set "default" can also be used as a base.
Except "default" and "example", all the other configuration sets of are
ignored by Home.

Each profile needs a set of files to work properly:
- DESCRIPTION, containing a description of a a given configuration
- FILES, containing a list of files completed by the location to where those
files should be linked. A single entry looks like that:

    file_name:to/file/path/.other_file_name
    file_name2:.file_name2

Note that each entry needs to be separated by a colon. The first entry
corresponds to the file as named in the folder dedicated to configuration.
The second entry is the location from $HOME of the link that will redirect
to the first entry. Note that for example to/file/path/.other_file_name
will create a link as $HOME/to/file/path/.other_file_name.

Spatch has been created to be implemented in Home and follows the same
license.
