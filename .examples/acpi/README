ACPI scripts
============

ACPI is a utility aimed at tracking keyboard events and interacts with
power management of a machine. This repository contains a set of scripts
that should be copied into /etc/acpi/.

There are two repositories:
- actions/, which contains working scripts that are invoked by the events.
- events/, which is a set of scripts aimed at tracking custom events and
kick actions based on what has been requested by the user.

Note that, at least for ThinkPad laptops, the kernel module thinkpad_acpi
needs to be loaded.

In order to use acpi, the following packages need to be installed:

    pacman -S acpi_call acpid

After installation the acpid daemon needs to be launched:

    systemctl enable acpid

Then when setting up those scripts it is useful to test the keyboard events
when pushing a given key, and acpi_listen is useful for this purpose after
the acpid deamon has been activated and started.

The set of scripts present here adds support for control of volume and
brightness. For the volume control, the card used is 0 by default as needed
by a ThinkPad. Note as well that the binary amixer is part of the package
alsa-utils.
