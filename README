Home, Michael Paquier
=====================

Home is a project allowing you to set up a Linux/Unix-based environment
with a simple GIT fetch. No more thinking about setting a hundred times
the same things in virtual machines or similar.

The environments are all based on the core features located on branch
master. This branch ignores all the settings done in all the other
environments so it can be fetched freely whatever the environment used.
It also maintains consistent all the features and folder structures that
are shared among all the environments.
Each other branch (XFCE, MacOSX, etc.) is based on the core features in
master. Each branch is maintained respecting the specificities of each
environment. In this case, each branch orientated to a given OS or desktop
environment is set up so as to ignore all the settings and all the
OS/desktop/environment dependent files of all the other environments so
you can check out freely each branch without impacting the environment
you are using.

When a commit impacts several branches, commit is done respecting the
following order priority:
- master, for core features
- linux, for Linux related features
- osx, for OS X features
This allows to keep the commit tree readable.
