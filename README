Home, Michael Paquier
=====================

Home is a project allowing you to set up a Linux/Unix-based environment
with a simple GIT fetch. No more thinking about setting a hundred times
the same things in virtual machines or similar.

The environments are all based on the core features located on branch
master. This branch ignores all the settings done in all the other
environments so it can be fetched freely whatever the environment used.
It also maintains consistent all the features and folder structures that
are shared among all the environments.
Additional branches can be created depending on very specific needs of
a configuration or OS, even if things are made to be a maximum OS-proof.

OS supported
------------

When a commit impacts several branches, commit is done respecting the
following order priority:

- master, for core features
- linux, for Linux related features

This allows to keep the commit tree readable. If the OS is not maintained
in a separate branch explicitely, using master is recommended.

Copyright information can be found in the file COPYRIGHT and license terms
can be found in the file LICENSE.

Private paths
-------------

Home provides paths to store private libraries, binaries, headers and
settings to very adaptable to the user's needs. Default environment
variables define those paths (which still need to be created btw):

- $HOME_LIB_EXTRA, to store private libraries. LD_LIBRARY_PATH and
 LIBRARY_PATH use that.
- $HOME_BIN_EXTRA, for private binaries. Included in PATH by default.
- $HOME_INCLUDE_EXTRA, for private headers. Included in C_INCLUDE_PATH.

It is not recommended to change those default values, as the same values
are hardcoded as well in .gitignore in the dedicated paths.

There is as well a set of files that can be used for private settings:

- $HOME/.bash_alias_extra, for private alias values
- $HOME/.bash_extra, for bash private values
- $HOME/.gitconfig_extra, for git private settings
- $HOME/.mutt_extra, for mutt private settings

All those files are linked automatically with spatch, a utility
written in bash to manage multiple setting profiles in a single
environment.

All the options available with spatch can be listed as follows:

    spatch -h

All those paths are ignored by Home. Those folders need to be created
by user if needed as well.

It is as well possible to hardcode them in the extra bash settings as
private settings are loaded after the settings of Home.
